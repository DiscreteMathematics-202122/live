    "## IMPORTANT - Indenting in Python\n",
    "**The colon and the indentation is critical in python** to specify a block of code statements, other languages such as java/processing use braces \"{}\", others use `begin`/`end`.  The use of indenting instead of braces to indicate structure is a **big deal** and forces, you the programmer, to always type (with correct spacing to the left) your code correctly before executing it.  If your code is not aligned correctly you will get a indentation error like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**IndentationError:** expected an indented block\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand why python uses indenting, read the following comment from [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io) the inventer of python or google \"Why does python using indenting?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> In order to separate blocks of code (like for loops, if blocks and function definitions) the compiler / interpreter needs something to tell it when a block ends. Curly braces and end statements are perfectly valid ways of providing this information for the compiler. For a human to be able to read the code indentation is a much better way of providing the visual cues about block structure. As indentation also contains all the information for the compiler, to use both would be redundant. As indentation is better for humans, it makes sense to use that for the compiler too. It has the advantage that Python programs tend to be uniformly and consistently indented, removing one hurdle to understanding other people's code. Python does not mandate how you indent (two spaces or four, tabs or spaces - but not both), just that you do it consistently. Those that get used to the Python way of doing things tend to start seeing curly braces as unnecessary line noise that clutters code. On the other hand, 'the whitespace thing' is possibly the single biggest reason why some developers refuse to even try Python."
