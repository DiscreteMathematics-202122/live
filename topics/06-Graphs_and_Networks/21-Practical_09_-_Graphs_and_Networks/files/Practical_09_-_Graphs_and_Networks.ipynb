    " * `G.nodes()` returns the nodes. We want to sort this to get nodes in alphabetical order. Simplest approach is to convert to a list using `list` and sort that using `sorted`.  So you might have something like `sorted(list(G.nodes()))`. Then use a `for` loop. \n",
    " * The degree of a node is obtained using `G.degree`. Again, remember that self-loops contribute 2 to the degree, so `\"s\"` has degree 3 even though it is connected to only one other letter. "
